Data Collection: This module interacts with the exchange's API or data provider to fetch necessary price and volume data. The timeframes for data collection are '5m', '15m', '1h', '4h', and '1d'.

Data Processing Module: This module processes the collected data and converts it into a format suitable for analysis. It may include tasks such as cleaning the data, handling missing values, and organizing it into the time intervals of '5m', '15m', '1h', '4h', and '1d'.

Trend Identification Module: This module determines the overall trend based on the VWMA (calculated on '15m', '1h', '4h' intervals) and weighted VWMA (calculated on '1d' intervals). It analyzes the processed data and identifies whether the trend is bullish or bearish.

Support and Resistance Identification Module: This module identifies support and resistance levels using techniques like price action analysis, Fibonacci levels, and the upper and lower bands of the Bollinger, Donchian and Keltner Channels. The timeframes used for support and resistance identification are '4h' and '1d'.

Signal Generation Module: This module generates trading signals based on the identified trend, support/resistance levels, and other conditions specified in the strategy. The timeframes used for signal generation are the same as those used for trend identification: '15m', '1h', and '4h'.

Risk Management Module: This module handles risk management aspects of the algorithm. It calculates the position size based on your risk management rules (like limiting each trade to use only 3 percent of your trading capital) and incorporates features such as a trailing stop loss and trailing take profit to manage risk and protect profits.

Trade Execution and Management Module: This module executes the trades based on the generated signals and manages the open positions. It interacts with the exchange's API to place trades, monitor the trades, and adjust stop loss and take profit levels as necessary.

Backtesting Module: This module allows you to backtest your trading strategy using historical data. It simulates trades based on past market conditions to evaluate the performance and profitability of your strategy. The timeframes used for backtesting should match those used in live trading: '5m', '15m', '1h', '4h', and '1d'.

Live Trading Module: This module enables your algorithm to trade live on the exchange. It connects to the exchange's API or uses websockets to receive real-time market data, generate signals, execute trades, and manage positions. The timeframes used for live trading should match those determined to be most effective in backtesting: '5m', '15m', '1h', '4h', and '1d'.

Monitoring and Logging Module: This module helps you monitor the performance of your algorithm, log important events, track metrics, and generate reports. It provides insights into the effectiveness of your strategy and assists in ongoing optimization. The timeframes used for monitoring and logging should match those determined to be most effective in live trading and backtesting: '5m', '15m', '1h', '4h', and '1d'.elps you monitor the performance of your algorithm, log important events, track metrics, and generate reports.
